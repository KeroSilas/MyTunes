### Known issues:
* On MacOS, the Media class will have trouble reading the duration of certain MP3 files.
* On certain PCs, the CSS styling for the sliders won't update properly.
* Unpausing after having paused will not resume the song exactly where it was paused (usually only off by 0.5 - 1 sec).
* Shuffle algorithm isn't very sophisticated.
