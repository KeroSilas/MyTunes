# MyTunes

### Known issues:
* On MacOS, the Media class will have trouble reading the duration of certain MP3 files.
* On certain PCs, the CSS styling for the sliders won't update properly.
* Unpausing after having paused will not resume the song exactly where it was paused (usually only off by 0.5 - 1 sec).
* Deleting a song from the "All songs" list will only delete that song from the selected playlist locally, however when you next launch the program, it will be gone from the other playlists as well.
* Shuffle algorithm isn't very sophisticated.
